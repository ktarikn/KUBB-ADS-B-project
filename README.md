This is a flight tracker application written in Python using OpenSky Network's REST API along with Folium and PyQt5 libraries to track flights in real-time and display them on a map.
It retrieves recent flight information of Turkey from OpenSky every 5 seconds, updates the map and visually represents the current state and trajectory of each aircraft.
It implements an interactive map interface, where the user can see detailed information for the desired aircraft.
